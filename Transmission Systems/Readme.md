# Transmission Systems Assignment (h)

## Assignment Details
For this assignment you are required to calculate the magnetic field level in the vicinity of a
distribution line. Calculate and plot the field levels at a distance of 1m above ground level and for a
distance of 20m either side of the line. Calculate the rms field level in Î¼T for the magnetic flux density.
Determine the field when the line is carrying rated power. 

For this assignment you have been allocated the following:

                            66kV overhead line, horizontal configuration
                                               and
                            66kV underground cable, horizontal configuration

You will need to determine the typical height of the overhead line and the depth of the conductors
for the underground cables and conductor spacing for both. (Ensure that you state all parameters
you use in your analysis and identify the source of this information.) Compare the field levels for
both the overhead and underground cable configurations. What conclusions do you draw?

Present your results in a report, addressing each of the sections and including relevant calculations
as required. Ensure you state any assumptions made. Include references to any sources you use.
Compare the field levels for the horizontal and vertical configurations. Prepare and submit a short
presentation of your main findings. This presentation will be given to the group.

## Due Date
