# Power Frequency Control 

## INTRODUCTION

he objective of this assignment is to study the power frequency response of an isolated area and then a two-area system when subject to small disturbances. This involves the development of an appropriate simulation model, either in Matlab or Simulink. For the isolated system, the simulation model allows the variation in system frequency to be studied for variations in the system load. For the interconnected system, a linear model of two power system areas connected by a tie-line (or interconnector), is used to examine the variation of area frequency and tie-line power flow after load disturbance.
This is a team assignment and you will be allocated into a group. The team will be required to arrange the work allocation between the members as there are a number of aspects to the assignment. Each group will also be allocated an additional element to complete.

## SYSTEM DETAILS

The system to be analysed is shown in Figure 1, representing two power system areas connected by a transmission line. Area A represents a thermal system and area B a hydro generation area. The investigations listed below are to be made using the Matlab/Simulink package. For each case, the appropriate Matlab program is to be developed. Alternatively, Simulink models can be developed to investigate the system. An example of a Matlab program for analysis of a single area without integral frequency control is available in Brightspace. Alternatively, an example of a Simulink model is also provided.

The details of the system are as follows:

The interconnection capacity is 50 MW and therefore T12 = 0.05. Also, δ1 - δ2 = -1.0 rad.
